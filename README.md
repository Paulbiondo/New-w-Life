# New-w-Life
I want to work to better the lives of felons in the community I want to build an outreach center and a strong Network and real support for those in need of legal services, free aid and networking for those in need of services in the community. This will group help fight suicide, homelessness of all ages and domestic abuse including emotional abuse, we will also f to i g ht for felon forgiveness and fight for careers for those of us with records. I want to use my past record and bad experiences as a platform to get the right people involved in a movement to shape society norms that have been cast down upon us and ideals that need to change such as our records and the thought that we will always be just our past. This will give those who have fallen on the same hard times as I believe and hope and dark times that we are more than just our past we are more than just a record and a number given to us we can work together and change and become better people and get the jobs and career choices we deserve because we are The underdogs and we know how to root for people in need because we've been there. Together we can  work twords the benefit of mankind. It is my passion to help the unsuspecting adult who cannot make decisions on their own the elderly as well, the underdogs, people without a voice who need to be heard and fight against stigmas and statistics and lables that are given to us we nolonger want.  Many people have records and pasts preventing us from creating a brighter future and moving on beyond our records and our past. I want to create education for those in need of it to get a better career and a better leg up in society
